# Coursera_capstone
This project aims to develop a model to predict the severity of car accident based on different factors.
I did my data science course capstone on the severity of car accidents in Seattle. More specifically, I did my research on what attributes leads to traffic accidents example road condition, vehicle condition, weather, light condition and if the driver is under influence of drugs or alcohol.
